# Customer Segmentation

This repository contains code and resources for performing customer segmentation analysis. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups or segments based on specific characteristics or behaviors. This analysis can help businesses gain insights into their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and make data-driven business decisions.

`git clone https://github.com/jhonny1677/customer-segementation.git`

After cloning the repository, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can execute the Streamlit App by running the Command:

`streamlit run app.py`


## Usage

Once you have the repository and dependencies set up, you can use the provided code to perform customer segmentation analysis. The main entry point is the `Customer Segmentation With Pycaret.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Open the notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to analyze your own customer data.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs. You can explore different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or visualization methods to enhance the analysis.

## Data

The data used for this analysis should be provided separately. The `input` directory in the repository contains a template CSV file (`jewel_data.csv`) to demonstrate the expected format. Replace this file with your own dataset or update the code accordingly.

Ensure that your data is preprocessed and in a suitable format before running the analysis. The notebook provides guidelines and examples for data preprocessing steps.

## Methods

This repository implements customer segmentation using various machine learning and statistical techniques. The methods used include:

- K-means clustering

Each method is implemented in a separate section of the `Customer Segmentation With Pycaret.ipynb` notebook. Detailed explanations and code examples are provided within the notebook to guide you through the analysis.

## Results

The results of the customer segmentation analysis are presented and visualized in the notebook. You will find interactive visualizations, cluster assignments, and insights derived from the segmentation process. Feel free to adapt the visualizations or metrics to suit your specific requirements.
